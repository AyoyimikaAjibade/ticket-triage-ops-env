# Ticket Triage Ops Environment (Gymnasium)

A deterministic, testable reinforcement learning environment that simulates an engineering/support ticket backlog.
This is designed as an **environment-as-a-product**: clean API, reproducible runs, unit tests, and a CLI.

## Why this matters
Many RL results fail to transfer because environments are toy problems or are not reproducible.
This project focuses on **engineering realism** (backlog + SLAs + regressions + context switching) and **strong software fundamentals**:
- deterministic simulation (seeded RNG)
- explicit reward breakdown in `info`
- unit tests for determinism + contract correctness
- CLI tools for rollout + validation

## Environment summary
**State (observation):**
- Open tickets with severity, age, component, SLA due-in, dependencies, blocked status, remaining work
- Engineers with busy/idle state and current assignment
- Global signals (time step, backlog size, avg age, SLA breaches, resolved count)

**Actions:**
- assign(ticket, engineer)
- escalate(ticket)
- request_info(ticket)
- defer(ticket)
- swarm(ticket)
- noop

**Dynamics:**
- new tickets arrive stochastically
- engineers progress work each step
- small probability of regressions (work increases)
- request_info blocks a ticket for a short delay

**Rewards (see `info["reward_breakdown"]`):**
- + for resolved tickets
- - for SLA breaches
- - for idle engineers while backlog exists
- - for context switching (reassignments)
- small costs for escalate / request_info / defer / swarm

**Termination:**
- truncated at a fixed horizon (end of week)
- early termination if ticket load explodes (safety condition)

## Installation
Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ticket-triage-ops-env
pip install -e ".[dev]"
